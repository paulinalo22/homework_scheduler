This nice and simple calendar app displays standard business hours. Within those time blocks, the user is able to write important activities and save them to the local storage with the lock button. Thus, once the page gets refreshed the activities will remain there!! 

One cool fact is that the page displays the current time and date, this allows the time blocks to change color depending on the time. Furthermore, it's easier to differentiate activities that happened, are happening or will happen in the future.
